## Introduction to TypeScript

TypeScript has become an essential tool in modern web development. As a superset of JavaScript, it adds optional static typing and other features that make code more maintainable and easier to understand.

## Key Benefits

### 1. Type Safety

TypeScript's main feature is its type system. This helps catch errors early in development:

```typescript
function greet(name: string) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

// This will error during compilation
greet(123); // Error: Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'
```

### 2. Better IDE Support

With TypeScript, you get:
- Improved autocomplete
- Better refactoring tools
- Inline documentation
- Real-time error detection

### 3. Enhanced Code Quality

TypeScript helps maintain code quality through:
- Interface definitions
- Type checking
- Code organization
- Clear dependencies

## Getting Started

Install TypeScript globally:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

Create your first TypeScript file:

```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

function createUser(user: User): User {
  return user;
}

const newUser = createUser({ name: "John", age: 30 });
```
