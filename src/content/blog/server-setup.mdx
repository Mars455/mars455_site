## Intro

Until recently, I had 2 servers. </br>
1 Ubuntu, 1 Windows 11 Pro. </br>
It was *really* inefficient, but I had it setup so the Windows machine was running Home Assistant as a vm (mainly because I wanted to be able to rdp into it) </br>
But then, I learned about proxmox from a friend and I had a new 1tb drive on the way..... </br>

## Specs

The specs of this machine are:

CPU: i5 9400 (6 Cores) 

RAM: 32GB DDR4 

SSD: 1TB NVME M.2
