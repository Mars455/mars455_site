#This page is a work in progress

##Intro

Until recently, I had 2 servers.
1 Ubuntu, 1 Windows 11 Pro.
It was *really* inefficient, but I had it setup so the Windows machine was running Home Assistant as a vm (mainly because I wanted to be able to rdp into it)
But then, I learned about proxmox from a friend and I had a new 1tb drive on the way.....

##Specs

The specs of this machine are:
CPU: i5 9400 (6 Cores)
RAM: 32GB DDR4
SSD: 1TB NVME M.2
HDD: Seagate IronWolf Pro 4 TB ST4000NE001 NAS Internal Hard Drive
OS: PVE / Ubuntu + HA
