## Introduction to my Mod

This is my first endeavour into a programming project in my own time, and to be honest I am having a blast!
This blog article is going to go over my plans, ideas and hopefully it'll all be met in the future!

## Plans + Current Content

### 1. Lightning Sets

At the time of writing this, I have already completed some of my ideas for the lightning tool set.
Originally, the plan was to *just* have this lightning toolset, but now I have decided to go beyond this and add more.
I am planning on using the lightning toolset to increase the speed of the player and smite the enemies with lightning. I have added this for the sword, but I do plan to add a base speed increase when wearing all 4 pieces of 'Shocking' armour.
The apple current strikes you with lightning, then gives speed and regeneration - so if you test this, make sure you aren't at too little health! I think this makes the apple kind of balanced.

### 2. Lava Sets

The Lava set is currently a work in progress, and is my next set after lightning.
Currently, there is a lava gem (uncraftable in GitHub at the moment) which places lava as a one time use - think of it as a stackable lava bucket! I am proud of this.
The sword also spawns lava which could get messy.
It does kind of act as an infinite lava source, so I'm not sure how I'm going to balance this yet. It is much slower than lightning - moving like a mace.

### 3. Pickle Sets

I'm planning on adding a Pickle Staff with 3d elements also, curious to see how this works out!

### 4. Ice Sets

I think my plan on the ice set is to *increase* the speed of the user through the armour, and slow down the speed of the enemy through attacking. COuld be quite fun to implement.

### 5. Fire Sets

The plan for fire is for it to be the 'base' damage type, just extra fire damage on top of the added bonuses for these gear sets.

### 6. Plant Sets

I think it could be quite interesting to use plant as a healing type, maybe lifesteal, or it could root the enemies as a chance.

### 7. Water Types

Perma water breathing? Speed under water? Who knows, but I'm curious to give this a go.

### 8. Magic Types

To be honest I just want something to fit the niche of pink / purple for the armour - can't go without that!

### 9. Air Types

I want this to work as a reverse mace, maybe moving enemies in the air, while granting slow fall to the user? Not sure!

### 10. Earth Type

This is 100% going to be the tank set.
Armour stats being much higher, and complete knockback resistance.
Maybe gives a slowness effect on hit with the sword?

## Other plans

My idea for this currently is to have a 'blaze' type enemy for each element.
We already have a blaze for fire, and a breeze for air, so I could make a new enemy for each of these.
As such the recipes I have for the moment, using 'elemental dust' will be removed on full release, but I just wanted to make sure that everything was craftable in survival.

### What do you think?

Let me know and I will hopefully be able to work on this soon!
