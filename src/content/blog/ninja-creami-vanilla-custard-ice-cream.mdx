When I first got the Ninja Creami yesterday, the first thing I whacked together was a quick and easy recipe so I could have some ice cream after dinner that same day. 

So, at 12 O'Clock, I mixed all the ingredients for this recipe and left it to freeze for only 5 hours. It worked and was an amazing consistency for Ice Cream. Here is how I made it!

### Ingredients

6tbsp Pudding Powder

<sup> I used a protein pudding mix I found on amazon. </sup>

400ml Milk (of your choice)

<sup> I used semi skimmed and it worked great </sup>

100ml Water

1tsp Vanilla Extract

### Recipe
Pour the powder and milk into a jug, then slowly add the milk and water until you get a thick custard-like mixture.

Add Vanilla Extract (to taste) and pour into the Creami tub.

Freeze for 5 hours.

Enjoy!

### Thoughts

This is a very simple recipe, and not perfect by any means. 

It does taste amazing though, and for same day ice cream cravings? It takes the cake!
