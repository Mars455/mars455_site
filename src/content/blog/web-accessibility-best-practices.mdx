## Why Web Accessibility Matters

Web accessibility ensures that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. Accessible websites benefit everyone, not just those with disabilities, by providing better user experiences across different devices and situations.

## Key Accessibility Guidelines

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provide a framework for making web content accessible. The guidelines are organized around four principles:

### 1. Perceivable

Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

- Provide text alternatives for non-text content
- Provide captions and alternatives for multimedia
- Create content that can be presented in different ways
- Make it easier for users to see and hear content

```html
<!-- Good example: Image with alt text -->
<img src="chart.png" alt="Bar chart showing sales growth from 2020-2023" />

<!-- Bad example: Image without alt text -->
<img src="chart.png" />
```

### 2. Operable

User interface components and navigation must be operable.

- Make all functionality available from a keyboard
- Give users enough time to read and use content
- Do not use content that could cause seizures
- Provide ways to help users navigate and find content

```html
<!-- Good example: Keyboard-accessible button -->
<button type="button" onclick="submitForm()">Submit</button>

<!-- Bad example: Div used as button without keyboard access -->
<div class="button" onclick="submitForm()">Submit</div>
```

### 3. Understandable

Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable.

- Make text readable and understandable
- Make content appear and operate in predictable ways
- Help users avoid and correct mistakes

```html
<!-- Good example: Form with clear labels and error messages -->
<label for="email">Email address:</label>
<input type="email" id="email" aria-describedby="email-error" />
<p id="email-error" class="error" role="alert" hidden>Please enter a valid email address</p>
```

### 4. Robust

Content must be robust enough to be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

- Maximize compatibility with current and future tools

```html
<!-- Good example: Semantic HTML5 -->
<article>
  <h1>Article Title</h1>
  <p>First paragraph...</p>
  <h2>Section Heading</h2>
  <p>More content...</p>
</article>

<!-- Bad example: Non-semantic markup -->
<div class="article">
  <div class="title">Article Title</div>
  <div class="paragraph">First paragraph...</div>
  <div class="subtitle">Section Heading</div>
  <div class="paragraph">More content...</div>
</div>
```

## Practical Implementation Tips

### 1. Use Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML provides meaning to your content, which helps assistive technologies understand your page:

- Use heading elements (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) in a logical hierarchy
- Use lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<dl>`) for list content
- Use `<button>` for clickable actions and `<a>` for navigation
- Use `<table>` for tabular data with proper headers

### 2. Implement ARIA When Necessary

ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes can enhance accessibility when HTML alone isn't sufficient:

```html
<div role="tablist">
  <button id="tab1" role="tab" aria-selected="true" aria-controls="panel1">Tab 1</button>
  <button id="tab2" role="tab" aria-selected="false" aria-controls="panel2">Tab 2</button>
</div>
<div id="panel1" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="tab1">Tab 1 content</div>
<div id="panel2" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="tab2" hidden>Tab 2 content</div>
```

### 3. Ensure Keyboard Accessibility

All interactive elements should be accessible via keyboard:

- Maintain a logical tab order
- Provide visible focus indicators
- Implement proper keyboard interactions for custom components

### 4. Test Your Website

Regular testing is crucial for accessibility:

- Use automated testing tools like Lighthouse, axe, or WAVE
- Test with a keyboard only (no mouse)
- Test with screen readers
- Conduct user testing with people with disabilities
