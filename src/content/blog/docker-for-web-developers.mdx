## Why Web Developers Should Learn Docker

Docker has become an essential tool for modern web development, offering numerous benefits:

- **Consistent Environments**: "It works on my machine" becomes a problem of the past
- **Simplified Onboarding**: New team members can set up development environments in minutes
- **Isolation**: Each project can have its own dependencies without conflicts
- **Production Parity**: Development environments closely mirror production
- **Simplified Deployment**: Package everything your application needs to run in a single container

## Docker Fundamentals for Web Developers

### Key Concepts

- **Images**: Read-only templates containing an OS, application code, and dependencies
- **Containers**: Running instances of images
- **Dockerfile**: Instructions for building an image
- **Volumes**: Persistent storage for containers
- **Networks**: How containers communicate
- **Docker Compose**: Tool for defining and running multi-container applications

### Your First Dockerfile

Here's a simple Dockerfile for a Node.js application:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Node.js runtime as a base image
FROM node:16-alpine

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Expose port 3000
EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Building and Running

```bash
# Build an image
docker build -t my-node-app .

# Run a container
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-node-app
```

## Docker Compose for Multi-Container Applications

Most web applications require multiple services (web server, database, cache, etc.). Docker Compose simplifies managing these with a single configuration file:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3'

services:
  # Node.js application
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./:/app
      - /app/node_modules
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
      - DB_HOST=db
      - DB_USER=postgres
      - DB_PASSWORD=example
    depends_on:
      - db
      - redis

  # PostgreSQL database
  db:
    image: postgres:13
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example
      POSTGRES_DB: myapp
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  # Redis cache
  redis:
    image: redis:6-alpine
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

To start all services:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Development Workflow with Docker

### Hot Reloading

For a smoother development experience, configure your application for hot reloading:

```dockerfile
# Development Dockerfile
FROM node:16-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Don't copy code - we'll use a volume mount instead

EXPOSE 3000

# Use nodemon for auto-reloading
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
```

Then in your docker-compose.yml:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - ./:/app
      - /app/node_modules  # This is a trick to use node_modules from the container
    # other configuration...
```

### Debugging

For Node.js applications, enable the inspector:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    command: ["node", "--inspect=0.0.0.0:9229", "server.js"]
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
      - "9229:9229"  # Expose debug port
```

### Common Tasks

```bash
# View logs
docker-compose logs -f web

# Open a shell in a running container
docker-compose exec web sh

# Run tests
docker-compose exec web npm test

# Restart a service
docker-compose restart web
```

## Docker for Different Web Stacks

### React Applications

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:16-alpine as build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Production stage
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

### Python Django Applications

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["python", "manage.py", "runserver", "0.0.0.0:8000"]
```

### PHP Laravel Applications

```dockerfile
FROM php:8.0-fpm

WORKDIR /var/www/html

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    libpng-dev \
    libjpeg-dev \
    libfreetype6-dev \
    zip \
    unzip

# Configure and install PHP extensions
RUN docker-php-ext-install pdo_mysql

# Install Composer
COPY --from=composer:latest /usr/bin/composer /usr/bin/composer

COPY . .

RUN composer install

CMD ["php", "artisan", "serve", "--host=0.0.0.0"]
```

## Best Practices

### Security

- Use specific image versions instead of `latest`
- Never store secrets in images
- Run containers as non-root users when possible
- Use multi-stage builds to reduce image size
- Scan images for vulnerabilities

### Performance

- Use .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files
- Layer your Dockerfile efficiently
- Use Alpine-based images for smaller footprints
- Leverage build caching

## Deployment Considerations

### Container Registries

Store your images in a registry like Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, or AWS ECR:

```bash
# Tag image for a registry
docker tag my-app:latest username/my-app:latest

# Push to registry
docker push username/my-app:latest
```

### Orchestration

For production deployments, consider using:

- **Docker Swarm**: Simple built-in orchestration
- **Kubernetes**: Advanced orchestration for complex applications
- **AWS ECS/EKS**: Managed container services
